          <h2>About </h2>
          <p>My name is Gauri Vashisth. I'm from Faridabad, Haryana. Currently, I'm in Toronto. I came here for my higher studies. Currently, I'm enrolled in Computer Programming 2 years diploma program. My college is Seneca and my campus is Seneca International Academy which is in Markham. My hobbies are traveling, playing badminton, watching movies, and playing video games. I love exploring new places. I'm a foodie so I love to try different kinds of food from different places. Sometimes I feel lonely because I'm alone here. I miss my parents a lot especially when there is some occasion. I'll call them soon. I enjoy traveling, so being in a new place was quite beneficial to me. I enjoy going to new areas and cities. The one disadvantage to living in a new nation that I've encountered thus far is being apart from my family. I really miss my parents. I intend to pay them a visit after my studies are over.  </p>
